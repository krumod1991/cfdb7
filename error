Have you checked for common technical issues?

Please ensure that your plugin adheres to best practices, including the following:

🔴 Proper sanitization of inputs

ℹ️ Why it matters: Sanitizing inputs is crucial for protecting against security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, handling invalid data, and ensuring that only safe, expected data is processed.
Please check the official WordPress docs on sanitizing for details — this is a quick summary.

🔍 Identify unsanitized inputs: Check any input coming from sources such as: $_GET , $_POST , $_REQUEST , $_COOKIE , $_SERVER , $_SESSION
If these inputs aren’t sanitized first, that’s a potential risk! 🕵️

🛠 Fix it: Always wrap any input with the right sanitization function, like:
Content
Function
Plain text
sanitize_text_field()
Email
sanitize_email()
URL
esc_url_raw()
Key
sanitize_key()
Integer
absint()

Refer to the official WordPress documentation for a complete list of sanitization functions.
👉 Use the most restrictive function that fits the expected content.
👉 Sanitize as early as possible — ideally as soon as the data is received.
👉 Only trust what you’ve cleaned yourself.

Example:
$post_id = (int) $_GET['post_id']; // Sanitized as an integer
$email = sanitize_email( $_GET['email'] ); // Sanitized as an email
Your data is now sanitized! 🧼🍏


Note: escape functions cannot be used to sanitize. They serve different purposes. Even if they seem to be perfect for this purpose, most of the functions are filterable and people expect to use them to escape. Therefore, another plugin may change what they do and make yours at risk and exploitable.

If you are trying to echo the variable, you have to first sanitize it and then escape it, as for example:
echo esc_html(sanitize_text_field($_POST['example']));
Example(s) from your plugin:
admin/partials/cfdb7_entries_export_all_entry_ids.php:56 <input type="hidden" id="referer_url" value="<?php echo esc_url($referer_url); ?>" />
 -----> esc_url($referer_url)
admin/partials/cfdb7_entries_export_entry_ids.php:55 <input type="hidden" id="referer_url" value="<?php echo esc_url($referer_url); ?>" />
 -----> esc_url($referer_url)
admin/partials/cfdb7_delete_entries_restore_ids.php:61 <input type="hidden" id="referer_url" value="<?php echo esc_url($referer_url); ?>" />
 -----> esc_url($referer_url)
admin/partials/cfdb7_entries_delete_entry_ids.php:86 <input type="hidden" id="referer_url" value="<?php echo esc_url($referer_url); ?>" />
 -----> esc_url($referer_url)

🔴 Proper escaping of outputs

ℹ️ Why it matters: Escaping prevents common security issues like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and avoids breaking the HTML structure.
Please check the official WordPress docs on escaping for details — this is a quick summary.

🔍 Identify unescaped outputs: Check any output ( echo , print , printf , etc. ) outputting a variable (like $title , $key ) or function result (like get_url() )
If the value is output without escaping, that’s a potential risk! 🕵️

🛠 Fix it: Always wrap any output with the proper escaping function depending on the context, like:
Context
Function
URLs
esc_url()
HTML attributes
esc_attr()
Text inside HTML tags
esc_html()
Raw HTML (careful!)
wp_kses() , wp_kses_post()

Refer to the official WordPress documentation for a complete list of escaping functions.
👉 Use the most restrictive function that fits the context.
👉 Escaping should be applied as late as possible, ideally right before output.

Example:
echo '<a href="' . esc_url( $profile_link ) . '" class="' . esc_attr( $username ) . '">' . esc_html( $display_name ) . '</a>';
Your output is now escaped!


Note: sanitize functions cannot be used to escape. They serve different purposes. Even if they seem to be perfect for this purpose, most of the functions are filterable and people expect to use them to sanitize. Therefore, another plugin may change what they do and make yours at risk and exploitable.

If you are trying to echo the variable, you have to first sanitize it and then escape it, as for example:
echo esc_html(sanitize_text_field($_POST['example']));
Example(s) from your plugin:
admin/partials/cfdb7_list_table_forms.php:36 $to_date = isset($_GET['to_date']) && !empty($_GET['to_date']) ? sanitize_text_field($_GET['to_date']) : '';
 -----> sanitize_text_field($_GET['to_date'])
admin/partials/cfdb7_list_table_forms.php:200 $to_date = isset($_GET['to_date']) && !empty($_GET['to_date']) ? sanitize_text_field($_GET['to_date']) : '';
 -----> sanitize_text_field($_GET['to_date'])
admin/partials/cfdb7_entry_logger_information.php:59 $avoid_field = isset($form_settings['avoid_field']) && !empty($form_settings['avoid_field']) ? sanitize_text_field($form_settings['avoid_field']) : "";
 -----> sanitize_text_field($form_settings['avoid_field'])
admin/partials/cfdb7_entry_logger_information.php:57 $avoid_duplicate_submission = isset($form_settings['avoid_duplicate_submission']) && !empty($form_settings['avoid_duplicate_submission']) ? sanitize_text_field($form_settings['avoid_duplicate_submission']) : "off";
 -----> sanitize_text_field($form_settings['avoid_duplicate_submission'])
... out of a total of 7 incidences.


Note: when you need to echo a JSON, it's better to make use of the function wp_json_encode , also, make sure you are not avoiding escaping with the options passed on the second parameter.
    echo wp_json_encode($array_or_object);
Example(s) from your plugin:
admin/class-cfdb7-pro-admin.php:920 echo json_encode($result);
admin/class-cfdb7-pro-admin.php:765 echo json_encode($result);
admin/class-cfdb7-pro-admin.php:1297 echo json_encode($result);
admin/class-cfdb7-pro-admin.php:584 echo json_encode($result);
... out of a total of 11 incidences.

🔴 Nonces and User Permissions Before Processing Requests

ℹ️ Why it matters: Nonces and permissions checks ensure that the request comes from a trusted source, protecting against security threats like CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.
Please check the official WordPress docs on nonces and this article for details — this is a quick summary.

🔍 Spot it: Look for functions that interact with $_GET , $_POST , $_REQUEST and perform actions triggered by the user/browser that modify data or perform sensitive actions (e.g., privileged actions or data manipulation). For such actions, you should always check for a nonce.
Additionally, verify user permissions if the action is restricted to certain roles (e.g., admin, editor).
When in doubt, play it safe: always check.

🛠 Fix it
Create a nonce ( wp_nonce_field() , wp_nonce_url() , wp_create_nonce() ). If you need to pass the nonce to JavaScript you can make use of wp_localize_script()
Pass it with the request.
Check the nonce ( check_admin_referer() , check_ajax_referer() , wp_verify_nonce() ) , and permissions if applicable ( current_user_can() ) .

Example (nonce check):
function cfdbpr_save_email(){
    if ( !isset( $_POST['cfdbpr_nonce'] ) || !wp_verify_nonce( sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( $_POST['cfdbpr_nonce'] ) ), 'cfdbpr_save_email_action' ) ) {
        wp_send_json_error( 'Invalid nonce.' );
    }

    if ( !current_user_can( 'edit_posts' ) ) {
        wp_send_json_error( 'Insufficient permissions.' );
    }

    if ( isset( $_POST['post_id'] ) && isset( $_POST['price'] ) ) {
        update_post_meta( absint( $_POST['post_id'] ), 'price', floatval( $_POST['price'] ) );
    }
}
add_action( 'wp_ajax_cfdbpr_save_email', 'cfdbpr_save_email' );
⚠️ Without nonce and permissions checks, anyone could call this AJAX endpoint and change the price data for any post - risky!

🔴 Use Prefixes for declarations, globals and stored data

ℹ️ Why it matters: Prefixing avoid naming collisions with other themes, plugins, or WordPress core functions.
A prefix is a string placed in front of a name to avoid collisions. It must be at least 4 characters long, feel distinct and unique to the plugin (do not use common words), and be separated by an underscore or dash.
Please check the official WordPress docs on avoiding name collisions.

🔍 Identify not prefixed names: Look for any name that is used in a place where it can create a collision.
Type of element
Affected elements
Declarations
Functions, classes, etc (if not under a namespace)
Globals
Global variables, namespaces, define() .
Data storage
update_option() , set_transient() , update_post_meta() , etc.
WordPress declarations
add_shortcode() , register_post_type() , add_menu_page() , wp_register_script() , wp_localize_script() , add_action( 'wp_ajax_...' ) , etc.

If the defined name for that is not prefixed, that’s a potential issue! 🕵️

🛠 Fix it: Always prefix those names, for example if your plugin is called "CFDB7 Pro" then you could use names like these:
function cfdbpr_save_post(){ ... }
class CFDBPR_Admin { ... }
update_option( 'cfdbpr_options', $options );
register_setting( 'cfdbpr_settings', 'cfdbpr_user_id', ... );
define( 'CFDBPR_PLUGIN_DIR', plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) );
global $cfdbpr_options;
add_action('wp_ajax_cfdbpr_save_data', ... );
namespace krumod\cfdb7pro;
Our tool has automatically detected these common issues, please check your code as there may be more names needing a prefix:
# Using the common word "custom" as a prefix.
admin/partials/cfdb7_entries_list_table.php:72 class Custom_WP_List_Table
admin/partials/cfdb7_delete_entries_list_table.php:67 class Custom_WP_List_Table
admin/partials/cfdb7_export_logs_list_table.php:67 class Custom_WP_List_Table
admin/partials/cfdb7_entry_logger_list_table.php:70 class Custom_WP_List_Table


Other details

We've detected some other details that you may want to check.

## Using load_plugin_textdomain() for loading the plugin translations is not needed for WordPress.org directory since WordPress 4.6.

When your plugin is hosted on WordPress.org you don't longer need to include load_plugin_textdomain() for the translations under your plugin slug "cfdb7-pro".

Therefore you can remove that call, WordPress will automatically load the translations for you when needed.

If you still support older WordPress versions you'll need to keep it, but please make sure to have the function call in a hook such as init to avoid issues for loading them too early. More information: https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/10/21/i18n-improvements-6-7/.

From your plugin:
includes/class-cfdb7-pro-i18n.php:35 load_plugin_textdomain('cfdb7-pro', false, dirname(dirname(plugin_basename(__FILE__))) . '/languages/');



## Out of Date Libraries

At least one of the 3rd party libraries you're using is out of date. Please upgrade to the latest stable version for better support and security. We do not recommend you use beta releases.

From your plugin:
admin/js/datatable/responsive.dataTables.js:1 🔴  *! DataTables styling
   # ↳ Possible URL: https://github.com/DataTables/DataTablesSrc
